podcastRank gets the top 100 podcasts from Apple's API and creates a TSV formatted list of the day's top 100 podcasts that can be easily opened in Excel. Each row contains a link to the Podcast Logo Thumbnail, a link to the podcast itself, and iTunes' primary and secondary (if available) category determinations.
